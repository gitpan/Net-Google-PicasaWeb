  my $feed = $class->from_feed($service, $entry);

This method creates the feed object from the service object and an L<XML::Twig::Elt> representing the element returned descring that object.

=cut

sub from_feed {
    my ($class, $service, $entry) = @_;

    my $url = $entry->field('id');
    $url =~ s/^\s+//; $url =~ s/\s+$//;
    $url =~ s{/data/entry/}{/data/feed/};

    my %params = (
        service  => $service,
        twig     => $entry,
        url      => $url,
        title    => $entry->field('title'),
        summary  => $entry->field('summary'),
        entry_id => $entry->field('gphoto:id'),
        user_id  => $entry->field('gphoto:user'),
    );

    if (my $author = $entry->first_child('author')) {
        $params{author_name} = $author->field('name')
            if $author->has_child('name');
        $params{author_uri}  = $author->field('uri')
            if $author->has_child('uri');
        $params{user_id}   ||= $author->field('gphoto:user')
            if $author->has_child('gphoto:user');
    }

    if (my $georss = $entry->first_child('georss:where')) {
        if (my $point = $georss->first_child('gml:Point')) {      
            if (my $pos = $point->field('gml:pos') ) {
                
                $pos =~ s/^\s+//;
                my ($lat, $lon) = split /\s+/, $pos, 2;

                $params{latitude}  = $lat;
                $params{longitude} = $lon;
            }
        }
    } 

    return $class->new(\%params);
}
